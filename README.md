This is a simple game inspired by the classic "hi-lo" number guessing game,
except that this is played with words. The secret is a randomly selected word
from a list of common words (although a lower bound on difficulty ensures that
extremely common words like "the" will not be chosen). The user is allowed to
repeatedly make guesses. The guesses must themselves be words: a Scrabble
dictionary is used to determine what guesses are valid.
